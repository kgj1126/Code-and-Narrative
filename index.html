  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Kara (on the right in the pic), I'm from State College, PA -- home of Penn State University. I am in my sophomore year as a Media and Professional Communications major, on the digital media track. I am also completing the Sports Studies and Digital Methods certificates, along with a History minor.</p>
    <p>Last year I took a CS class: Website Design and Development, which I absolutely hated in the beginning until we got to the creating part. For the final project, I made a website about a topic I really loved and was interested in. I ended up using it for another class that semester as well. Even though I'm still not the biggest fan of coding, it is fun to be able to understand another part of how things can be created from nothing.</p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h1>Everyday Code</h1>
    <h3>How does code affect what we think, do, and how we move through the world? What did you learn about yourself by completing the Dear Data visualization activity? What did the data get right? What did it get wrong? What else does the data say? Do you have any other thoughts or commentary?</h3>
    <p>Code is the backbone of everything digital. Even back to the big rooms filled with machines that did mathematics. Today, as I type this within the code, there is still other code making the letters show up on my screen as I tap the keys on the keyboard.</p>
    <p>I actually learned a bunch about my technology habits from this activity. I knew a couple of things, like my Canvas and search engines times from using them for writing (Google Drive on Google Chrome) or just research (Safari). I also felt it was important to include my iPad use since it's another key part of my daily life, even if it is just to watch stuff. I use it also for notetaking in some classes with Notability. I think that Spotify should be existent on my phone time since it's normally in the background playing. Since I'm not physically on the app, it doesn't show a higher ranking like on my computer. I actually also thought that my Instagram and Threads time would be larger as I feel like I'm always on them, so I'm glad at the surprise of the averages being about 1 hour each for Instagram and Threads. I also love watching movies and tv shows, so I wasn't surprised at the high times for each of the applications I frequented. </p>
    <p>Overall, I had a broad aray of applications I use daily, but that does mean they add up a lot quicker, which can be seen with my daily time averaging 15 hours a day. With that average, though, I do use most of my devices simultaneously, so it's not a good measure of what my true daily average use is. </p>

<!--In this section, we'll move from talking about us to how code and digital technology has affected the rhetoric and composition classroom-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h1>Code and Digital Technology Impact on Education</h1>
    <h3>How has code and digital technology changed what and how we learn? Why is it important to address? Think about the role code/CS play in our digital literacies?</h3>
  <p>I remember in Kindergarten, each class had a tech cart with iPads for each student. I barely remember what exaclty we would do on them besides some sort of learning, though. Moving up to 3rd grade, each class still had a tech cart, but now with MacBook Airs that we would practice our typing skills on. By 5th grade, we all had our own school email set up and mainly using our computers for every writing assignment. In 6th grade we got our own chromebooks that we could take home and do all of our assignments on, for the most part.</p>
    <p>I think by us addressing our learning history with technology, we can see how advanced technology has really gotten. It's very weird to look back and see even as 5-year-olds, we were given technology to learn while in a classroom. Our generation was born into the beginnings of the digital era, but we still remember parts of our childhood without digital technology overtaking our play.</p>

  <h1>Moving Forward with Technology</h1>
    <h3>Where do you see code and technology taking you? What do you want to learn more about in terms of code, digital tools, and technology?</h3>
    <p>Within my major, and thus my job area, I think code and technology in general are already a major part of it. So moving forward into the future, this area of specialization will become more flush with technological advancements, especially with AI on such a rise.</p>
    <p>I think I want to learn more styling techniques within code since, like I said, it is the backbone of everything digitally technical. </p>
